**Project Idea(s):**
### Idea 1 
Given a list of tasks, time constraints, and priority weight, automatically fill out the times they should be working on which task, and export that to GCal. Dynamically changes when adding more tasks/meetings to optimally fill time. 
Issue tracker.


### Idea 2
A software that can look at a corpus of memes, and then generates a set of relevant keywords that apply to each meme by looking at their content and comment section. You can then sift through the memes via a certain hashtag (or multiple), and find memes that are relevant to any and all meme pages.


### Idea 3
Use the userâ€™s spotify song history to identify the emotions most commonly associated with them. Create a histogram/map of how the users song-emotions change over time / per playlist, etc.
